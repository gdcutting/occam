## OCCAM Documentation  

Welcome to the documentation section of the OCCAM repository. Browse the docs here, or see [OCCAM documentation hosted by readthedocs.org](https://occam.readthedocs.io).

Some of the documentation here is outdated. We continue to provide it because we are in the process of performing some structural upgrades to OCCAM, and the previous design documents provide some insight into the OCCAM application structure.

We are currently working on producing more updated documentation, so please check this page periodically.
